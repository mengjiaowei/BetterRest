# SwiftUI Sleep Calculator

This SwiftUI project is a simple Sleep Calculator app that helps users determine their ideal bedtime based on wake-up time, estimated sleep duration, and coffee consumption. The project was developed as part of the Hacking with Swift SwiftUI 100 Days challenge.

## Features

- **Wake-up Time Selection**: Users can choose their desired wake-up time using a DatePicker.
- **Estimated Sleep Duration**: The app calculates the ideal bedtime based on the selected wake-up time, estimated sleep duration, and coffee consumption.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is built using SwiftUI, providing a clean and responsive design.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical SwiftUI organization:

- **ContentView.swift**: Main view containing the Sleep Calculator interface.
- **SleepCalculator.swift**: The logic for calculating the ideal bedtime based on user inputs.
- **Assets.xcassets**: Asset catalog for storing project images.

## Personal contribution

The app was developed with a personal challenge in mind: removing the "Calculate" button. Instead of relying on a button press, the ideal bedtime is automatically updated when the user changes the wake-up time using the DatePicker.
